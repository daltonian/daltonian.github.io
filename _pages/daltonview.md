### DaltonView

DaltonView is a simple GUI which allows the user to make adjustments to the parameters used to plot the TD-DFT vertical excitation spectrum. Currently, two types of distribution functions are used to apply peaks to the excitations: Gaussian and Lorentzian. The Lorentzian line shapes are expectedly sharper at the center (excitation energy) but have slower tails to zero.
